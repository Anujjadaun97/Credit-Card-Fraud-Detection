Based on the content of the Jupyter Notebook [Credit_card_Fraud_detection.ipynb](https://github.com/Anujjadaun97/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection/blob/main/Credit_card_Fraud_detection.ipynb), here is a draft for a GitHub README file:

### Credit Card Fraud Detection

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates a credit card fraud detection project using a Logistic Regression model. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent.

### Project Steps

The notebook follows a clear and structured approach to the problem:

* **Credit card data:** The project uses a credit card transaction dataset.
* **Data Processing:** The data is processed to handle missing values and prepare it for analysis. The notebook specifically shows that there are some missing values in the dataset which are then dropped.
* **Data Analysis:** The notebook includes an analysis of the data, showing the distribution of legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
* **Train Test Split:** The data is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
* **Logistic Regression Model:** A Logistic Regression model is used to train on the processed data.
* **Model Evaluation:** The final model is evaluated to determine its accuracy.

### Dependencies

The following Python libraries are used in this project:

* `numpy`
* `pandas`
* `sklearn` (specifically `train_test_split`, `LogisticRegression`, and `accuracy_score` from `sklearn.model_selection` and `sklearn.linear_model` and `sklearn.metrics` respectively)
